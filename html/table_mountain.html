        Table Mountain is a flat-topped mountain forming a prominent landmark overlooking the city of Cape Town in South Africa.
        It is a significant tourist attraction, with many visitors using the cableway or hiking to the top. The mountain forms part
        of the Table Mountain National Park, and part of the lands formerly ranged by Khoe-speaking clans. It is home to a large
        array of mostly endemic fauna and flora.
