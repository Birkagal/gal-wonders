                The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient
                Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls
                were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206
                BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties have built and
                maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty
                (1368–1644).
